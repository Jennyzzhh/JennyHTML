                <p>Supply chain management (SCM) is the discipline that manages the flow of supplies through all of the stages of a production cycle. SCM applies to any organization that executes projects, produces goods or provides services, as those activities require a supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources.</p>

                <p>To get the most out of SCM requires looking at the big picture in terms of an organizations management. No longer is managing an individual company function enough. The integration of all activities involved in the supply chain is necessary: that means integration between different departments, such as purchasing and marketing.

                    Supply chain management also needs integration and collaboration between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems and shared information. Here are the most important parts of any SCM system or model.
                    
                    Customer-Relations Management: There must be a managed approach to interacting with the company’s current and potential customers in order to understand what they want and expect.
                    Customer-Service Management: This differs from customer-relations management in that it focuses on the interactions between the customer and the company instead of a more strategic management process. It helps facilitate a mutually satisfying goal for both customer and the company, as well as eliciting customer feedback and maintaining communications between the two parties, so there are positive feelings from both parties.
                    Demand-Management Style: A methodology to forecast, plan for and manage the demand for products and services. This can address both macro-levels, as in global economics, but also micro-levels within the company.
                    Order Fulfillment: The process that encompasses everything from point-of-sale interest to delivery of that product or service to the customer. It is the way a company responds to customer orders.
                    Manufacturing-Flow Management: Manufacturing is a process, and supplies feed that process based on historic data surrounding how it has been done and what was needed historically. But that process needs flexibility as quantities change. Therefore, one must manage all activities related to planning, scheduling and managing the manufacturing process.
                    Supplier Relationship Management (SRM): Supplies likely are coming from a third party, and those interactions must be strategically planned for. SRM is key to a healthy supply chain.
                    Product Development and Commercialization: To reduce time to market, customers and suppliers are integrated into product vision and the product development process. Shortening the product life cycle keeps the company competitive. This process includes coordinating with customer relationship management to know customer needs, selecting materials and suppliers with procurement and developing a production technology in the flow of manufacturing to integrate the best supply chain flow for the product and market. When successful, this has a positive impact on cost, quality, delivery and market share.
                    Returns Management: There will always be returns and the better they’re managed, the more productive and competitive the SCM process. Management of this aspect of the SCM means fast and easy returns management, automation and deciding how to process returned materials. Make sure information is visible to capture early in the process. Then control the flow of product, including receipts and reconciliation, noting if there are any quality issues.</p>
